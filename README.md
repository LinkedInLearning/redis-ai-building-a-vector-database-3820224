This course shows developers how to exploit the ready-made AI-related tools in Redis to build a vector database. Instructor Fernando Doglio starts with a look at structured versus unstructured data and AI-optimized databases, then jumps into Redis Enterprise to talk about how developers can use it as a vector DB. He also showcases examples like recommendation engines, semantic search, and others.
